// dear diary, today I encountered a script so ancient it nearly turned to dust upon inspection
// all this code, just to avoid saying "i'm out of touch with modern js":

class Modernizr {
  // a constructor, because even dinosaur code deserves evolution
  constructor() {
    this.results = {};
  }

  // run a test and store the result, because we're about efficiency now
  testFeature(feature, test) {
    this.results[feature] = test();
  }

  // get all results, because you're going to ask for them anyway
  getResults() {
    return this.results;
  }

  // public methods for each feature because apparently using objects was too mainstream
  // I'll spare my sanity and implement just one as an example
  canvas() {
    this.testFeature('canvas', () => !!document.createElement('canvas').getContext);
  }
}

// a small sampling of how you really should've written Modernizr tests
let mod = new Modernizr();
mod.canvas();

// and how to get the results without offending modern standards
console.log(mod.getResults());
